Here are some open-source datasets related to solar energy along with their links:

- **National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Solar Radiation Data**: This dataset includes solar radiation and related climatic data for locations in the United States and its territories. The data is collected by NREL and is available for download at https://data.nrel.gov/search-page/Solar.

- **Open PV Project**: This dataset provides information on the installed photovoltaic (PV) systems in the United States. It includes data on the size, location, and cost of the installations, as well as information on the type of PV technology used. The data can be downloaded from https://openpv.nrel.gov/.

- **Global Solar Atlas**: This dataset provides information on solar resource potential globally. It includes maps of solar radiation, temperature, and other relevant parameters for every location on earth. The data is available for download at https://globalsolaratlas.info/.

- **Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS)**: This dataset provides estimates of the solar energy potential for locations in the European Union and other countries. It includes data on solar radiation, temperature, and other relevant parameters. The data can be downloaded from https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/pvgis.

- **National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)**: This dataset provides hourly solar radiation and meteorological data for locations in the United States and its territories. The data is collected by NREL and is available for download at https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/.

- **Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) Solar Market Insight**: This dataset provides information on the solar market in the United States, including data on installation trends, market share, and pricing. The data can be downloaded from https://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight.

- **National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)**: Institue provides tools and datasets for irridation monitoring, solar and wind integration in real-time or historical data. The site can be found at [https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-resource/sun-position.html](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/all-data-tools.html).

- **PV-Live**: This dataset provides real-time data on solar energy generation in the United Kingdom. It includes data on the total amount of solar energy generated, as well as data on individual solar installations. The data can be downloaded from https://www.solar.sheffield.ac.uk/pvlive/.
